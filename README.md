# AI-Enhanced-System-Call-Optimization
The goal of this project is to reduce system call latency by integrating lightweight AI-inspired logic into the system call handling flow. Instead of treating all system calls equally, our system attempts to:  Detect patterns in system call usage  Predict upcoming frequently-used calls  Reorder or prioritize them for faster completion
